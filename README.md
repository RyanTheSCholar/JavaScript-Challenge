## Description

My motivation for this was to get a baseline of knowledge for Javascript, I built this project for people who want a random password. This solves a problem for people who can't think of a password. I learned more in-depth on for loops, Math.floor(), Math.random(). different methods for pushing, creating strings, concatenating arrays into an empty array or an existing array and much more, this is just to name a few of things I found notable.
